            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A Declaration of the falſhood in a Pamphlet intituled, <hi>A Meſſage from the Iſle of Wight, &amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>TO confute the many Lying and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Pamphlets wherewith this age abounds, (to the prejudice of truth and continuance of our diviſions, and ſo to the provoking of the wrath of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a lying, and lye-believing generation) would be a buſie and hard taske, becauſe the Devill, the father of lyes is maliciouſly indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious, &amp; his children numerous. Yet I cannot but take notice of one moſt eminently falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, ſo as to contradict it by my knowledge: &amp; I do it not ſo much to rebuke the informer as to undeceive the ſo ſimple people that are more ready to blieve ſuch falſhoods, then to indeavour to know the truth: as for thoſe who are knowing and ſober, I miſtruſt them not; becauſe wiſe enough to diſcern not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly falſhoods, but improbabilities alſo.</p>
            <p>The Pamphlet wherein this monſter lye
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:117023:3"/>is couched, bears the Title of <hi>A Meſſage from the Iſle of</hi> Wight, <hi>brought by Major</hi> Cromwell: wherein I find the pretended heads of Biſhop <hi>Uſher</hi>'s Sermon at the Iſle of <hi>Wight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now though I have more then a proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conjecture, That the Biſhops integritie ſo well known is a ſufficient confutation of ſo ignorant and malignant an intelligencer as he that communicates thoſe untruths: yet certainly thoſe that live more remote, and have not the Cognizance of men by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but by reports, had need be informed of the truth and falſhood of ſuch reports, leſt our charity be overpreſt, and, not hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thoſe reports contradicted, may ſuſpect, and at length believe what is not true; and therefore, being experimentally aſſured of the falſneſſe of this report, I dare ſay he was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Scholler, nor good Chriſtian, that gave that information: or if he had been truly a Gentleman or clearly rationall, hee would have been aſhamed of his traducements. Sure it is he had malignity enough; and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill his maſter in this trade of lying ought him a ſhame, and could pay him no better, then to ſtirre him up againſt the ſo well
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:117023:3"/>known truth and integrity of that pious man.</p>
            <p>The firſt untruth is (That the Biſhop of <hi>Armaugh hath much prejudiced the preſent Treaty.</hi>) The falſhood of this may juſtly call all the reſt in queſtion; For 'tis very wel known, that no man hath been more faithfull in what he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook then the good man accuſed; nor would have hazarded more in procuring a well-grounded Peace, then himſelfe; and to then end improved his beſt intereſt; though this maligner hath thus reported.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Informer ſaith, <hi>Hee ſawned upon the King, flattering his Majeſtie?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Good Reader, judge whether the King were in a condition to be flattered? or whether the Biſhop of <hi>Armaugh</hi> expected any prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the King? 'Tis well knowne by them which know the Biſhop, that hee nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hopes for, nor cares for much in this world of what man can confer on him; and ſure if he would be a flatterer, he tooke an ill aime, and a wrong perſon, to ſlatter the King is not now the thriving way; yet this accuſer would faine make you forfeit your judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and charitie to this beliefe.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:117023:4"/> 3. That the Biſhop <hi>being asked</hi> (by ſome of the Court) <hi>why he preached ſo to highten the King, at ſuch a time as this?</hi> This is a meere fiction: none at Court asked this queſtion; But that which makes this altogether improbable is the Biſhops anſwer, as hee reports, That the Biſhop excuſed it thus: <hi>That 'twas not preme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated what he preached; and that if anything gave offence, it was to be imputed to the diſtemper of his brain after his journey.</hi> Truly if the Biſhop had made this excuſe, I ſhould have ſuſpected indeed the diſtemper of his brain, and judge you whether ten dayes after he came into the Iſland were not ſufficient to reſt himſelf after his journey; and ſo long he was there ere he preached. Beſides, the Biſhop doth not preach nonſence, nor without premeditation at any time: ſure he would not chooſe to doe it at ſuch a time as that was: and, good reader, can you be drawn to imagine that the Biſhop of <hi>Armaugh</hi> would preach ſo fillily on that text as thoſe inferences are which this malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſets down with as much boldneſſe as ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance? I am at a bluſh for his folly.</p>
            <p>Yet Imuſt confeſſe this much of what he writes is true, That the Biſhop preached on
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:117023:4"/>that text cited by him, and the former part of his fourth inference, that it was his Majeſties 49 year, the year of Jubilie, and he hoped 'twould prove ſo to his Majeſt: but the laſt clauſe is moſt falſe, <hi>viz.</hi> (that he ſaid, <hi>His Majeſty was more ſtrictly dealt withall.</hi>)</p>
            <p>So that of ſeaven inferences which he notes, ſix of them are utterly falſe, and the ſeaventh but halfe true. And thus much hee avoucheth, who himſelfe was a more faithfull and indifferent hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer then he who hath laboured to defile the reputation of him whoſe Innocencie will one day plead for him, when ſuch a man as this infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſhall not be able to ſtand in the judgement.</p>
            <p>Now concerning his whole carriage at the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> nothing but envy can aſperſe his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gritie and zeale for an happy accommodation 'twixt the King and his people. and to this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Teſtimony of his own conſcience, hee hath good witneſſes, if they will ſpeak but what they know of him. And as for ſuch as are of none, or of ſmall reputation, it is not much to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe what they ſay. And therefore I preſume I need ſay no more to ſatisfie any ſober and unbia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in this point: though I might have ſaid more to the informers refutations. But the folly of his
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:117023:5"/>madneſs is and wil be ſufficiently made known. And in the mean time I have a word of advice to him for his good; Firſt, to repent for the falſhoods he hath uttered; and confeſſe and be ſorry that he hath wronged a ſervant of Chriſt, and leſt in ſtead of ſuch a rebuke as this, the wrath of God come upon him, if after this time he ſin wilfully again in this kind, for no lyar ſhall enter into the kingdom of God. I have a word likewiſe to the over credulous people; be not you deceived, nor believe every report, for he that receiveth, and he that telleth lyes, are both in the ſame tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. To backbite, and to take up a reproach againſt another, are the ſymptomes of ſuch as have no dwelling in the holy hill, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15.3. And as for the Biſhop of <hi>Armaugh,</hi> I need ſay nothing to him, he knows how to bear with patience all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, and ſtripes of invenomed tongues, and to contemn them (as things farre beneath him:) and if any of you will yet be more vile, more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious againſt him, his return would be, not to bring rayling for rayling, but bleſſing for curſing; &amp; at the extremity, but, <hi>The Lord rebuke thee, Iude v.</hi> 9.</p>
            <p>Thus much I could not but ſay to ſo bitter an accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and unjuſt, untrue, I commit all to he knower of hearts, who will one day diſcover, Hypocriſies and lyes, and render proportionably to their deſervings.</p>
